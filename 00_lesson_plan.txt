# Features of c

## Basic features of c
- Functions
- Primitive types (int, bool, char, a few others)
- Arrays (contiguous memory)
- Casting

## Special features of c
- Pointers
- Address-of (get pointer to thing)
- Dereferencing (get thing from pointer)
- Pointer array indexing (dereference from offset of pointer)
- Structs
- "Strings" (character arrays/pointers)

## Missing from c
- Arrays as you know them
- Objects as you know them
- No real strings

# Concepts

## Simplified architecture model
- Memory as array of bytes
- Registers like processor's workbook
- Processor as state machine

## Memory
- Split into sections:
- Code
- Globals and constants
- Stack (function working memory)
- Heap (memory given by OS)
- Unusable

## Registers
- Store the state of the process
- Saved off so CPU can work on different processes, loaded to resume working
- General-purpose registers: EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX
- Instruction pointer: EIP
- Stack pointer, base pointer: ESP, EBP

## Processor
- Reads instruction at EIP
- Performs instruction read
- Advances EIP to next instruction, or change entirely with jump or call
